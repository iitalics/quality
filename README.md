# quality
Finally a quality programming language

Written by Milo Turner & Zachery Casey

# Compiler
Compiles to C or uses `cc` to compile to a binary.

# File extension
All quality source files are appended with the extension '.ql'. The compiler refuses to take input without such an extension.

# Macro system
M4 is currently being used for the macro system... Official writeup of usage is TODO. Currently, default M4 usage is supported, rather than an official style.

# Requirements
- M4
- ocaml
- Menhir (opam install menhir)
- Batteries (See Batteries docs)
